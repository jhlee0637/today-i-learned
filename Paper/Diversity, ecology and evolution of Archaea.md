- Carl Woese
	- divided living things into three domains(Eukarya, Eubacteria, Archaebacteria)
	- Controversy: similarity between Archaea and Eukaryotic organism    
	  (histones, complex RNA polymerase, lack of peptidoglycan...)

- The innovations of sequencing tech
	- Lead to discovery deeply branching groups of Archaea which are impossible to culture
	- And, lead to the matter of "microbial dark matter"
		- Reconstruction of archaeal genomes revealed how many unknown organisms are existed.

# Three main groups of Archaea (superphyla)
_(Euryachaeota is excluded from these three groups)_
1. Asgard
2. DPANN: Diapherotrites, Parvarchaeota, Aenigmarchaeota, Nanohaloarchaeota, Nanoarchaeota
3. TACK: Thaumarchaeota, Aigarchaeota, Crenarchaeota,Korarchaeota

- 16S rRNA phylogenies
	- choosn for their limited lateral gene transfer
	- their consistency in the clustering of phyla with rRNA phylogenies
	- their broad distribution throughout the tree of life.
## Euryarchaeota
- Mostly they are extremophiles
### Methan~
- methane production, anaerobic methane oxidation...
    - ANME: anaerobic methane oxidizers
    - Candidatus syntrophoarchaeum: butane oxidation with methanogenesis-like pathway.
### Thermoplasmata
### Halophilic
### Acidophilic

## DPANN superphylum
## TACK superphylum
- Mesophilic Crenarchaeota(MG-I, MCG Archaea, MBG-A, MBG-E, TMCG) became TACK group
- TACK
	- T: Thaumarchaeota
	- A: Aigarchaeota
	- C: Crenarchaeota
	- K: Korarchaeota
### **Crenarchaeota**
- first cultured from hot springs in Yellowstone National Park
- anaerobic heterotrophs
- _Sulfolobus spp_. have become model archaea for studies of hyperthermophiles and viral interactions
### **Thaumarchaeota**
- oxidize ammonia at the low concentrations found in the open ocean
- obtain ammonia from urea and cya- nate
- have important links to climate change, as their activity has been linked to the production of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide
- Major questions still remain about the exact biochemistry of thaumarchaeal ammonia oxidation
### **Bathyarchaeota**
- they are ubiquitous, abundant and highly diverse in anoxic marine, anoxic freshwater and high temperature hot spring locations
- remineralize detrital proteins, possibly coupling protein degrada- tion to hydrogen production
- they are involved in protein and cellulose degradation as well as CO2 fixation.
- first mcr genes occurring outside the Euryarchaeota.

## **Asgard superphylum**

- it was suggested that Lokiarchaeota might be descendants of the progenitor archaea that lead to eukaryotes.
- hypothesis: an ancestor of the Asgard Archaea was the archaeal host of the symbiotic interaction with a proteobacterium, which later became mitochondria and formed early eukaryotic cells.
- suggesting that many Asgard Archaea are involved in syntrophic interactions.
