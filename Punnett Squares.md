- The specific ratios seen in the monohybrid cross can be described using a **Punnett square**, named after R.C. Punnett who devised this approach.

- A Punnett square is a matrix in which all of the possible gametes produced by one parent are listed along one axis, and the gametes from the other parent are listed along the other axis.
- Each possible combination of gametes is listed at the intersection of each row and column, since we know through the process of meiosis that the alleles on each chromosome separate to form the gametes.
- The offspring ratios will be 3:1 of dominant phenotype (purple): recessive phenotype (white).
- Punnett squares can also be used to calculate the frequency of offspring.
- The frequency of each offspring is the frequency of the male gametes multiplied by the frequency of the female gamete.
