- Mendel’s first law, the law of segregation states that every individual contains a pair of alleles for each gene, which segregate during the formation of gametes, and so for every gene pair, each parent passes on a random allele to its offspring.

- A specific position, region, or segment along a chromosome is called a **locus**.
	- Each gene occupies a specific locus (so the terms locus and gene are often used interchangeably).
	- Each locus will have an allelic form (allele).
- The complete set of alleles (at all loci of interest) in an individual is its **genotype**.
	- Typically, when writing out a genotype, only the alleles at the locus (loci) of interest are considered – all the others are present and assumed to be wild type but are normally not written in the genotype.
- The observable or detectable effect of these alleles on the structure or function of that individual is called its **phenotype**.
	- The phenotype studied in any particular genetic experiment may range from simple, visible traits such as hair color, to more complex phenotypes including disease susceptibility or behavior.
	- If two alleles are present in an individual, then various interactions between them may influence their expression in the phenotype.
