- Mendel’s first law, the law of segregation, states that every individual contains a pair of alleles for each gene
- Alleles segregate during the formation of gametes, and so for every gene pair, each parent passes on a random allele to its offspring.
- A specific position, region, or segment along a chromosome is called a **locus**.
	- Each gene occupies a specific locus (so the terms locus and gene are often used interchangeably).
	- Each locus will have an allelic form (allele).
- The complete set of alleles (at all loci of interest) in an individual is its **genotype**.
	- Typically, when writing out a genotype, only the alleles at the locus (loci) of interest are considered – all the others are present and assumed to be wild type but are normally not written in the genotype.
- The observable or detectable effect of these alleles on the structure or function of that individual is called its **phenotype**.
	- The phenotype studied in any particular genetic experiment may range from simple, visible traits such as hair color, to more complex phenotypes including disease susceptibility or behavior.
	- If two alleles are present in an individual, then various interactions between them may influence their expression in the phenotype.
## True-Bredding Lines
- In-bred populations of plants or animals in which all parents and their offspring have the same phenotypes with respect to a particular trait.
- They are typically assumed to be homozygous for the alleles that affect the trait of interest.
- When two individuals that are homozygous for the same alleles are crossed, all of their offspring will all also be homozygous.
- The continuation of such crosses constitutes a true breeding line or strain.

## Monohybrid Crosses
- A **monohybrid cross** is one in which both parents are heterozygous (or a hybrid) for a single (mono) trait.
- By using monohybrid crosses, Mendel discovered that genes were discrete units that separated in the creation of offspring.
- Through the monohybrid cross Mendel was able to discern the **dominant** and **recessive** alleles of each gene he studied in the pea plants.
- In further crosses, these traits were continuously transmitted and not lost.
