- Genotypes must be inferred based on phenotypes.    
  유전형(genotype)은 표현형(phenotype)을 기본으로 한다
- Because of dominance, it is often not possible to distinguish between a heterozygote and a homozygote based on phenotype alone (e.g., see the purple-flowered F2 plants).    
  우성인자(dominance) 때문에, 이형접합(heterozygote)과 동형접합(homozygote)을 표현형(phenotype)만 보고서는 판단할 수 없다
- To determine the genotype of a specific individual, a **test cross** can be performed in which the individual with an unknown genotype is crossed with an individual that is homozygous recessive for all of the loci being tested.
	- For example, if you were given a pea plant with purple flowers it might be a homozygote (_AA_) or a heterozygote (_Aa_).
	- You could cross this purple-flowered plant to a white-flowered plant as a **tester**, since you know the genotype of the tester is _aa_.
	- Depending on the genotype of the purple-flowered parent (**Figure 1.6.1**), you will observe one of two phenotypic ratios in the F1 generation.

	- If the purple-flowered parent was a homozygote _AA_, all of the F1 progeny will be purple.
	- If the purple-flowered parent was a heterozygote _Aa_, the F1 progeny should segregate purple-flowered and white-flowered plants in a 1:1 ratio.
