[Opengenetics: Somatic vs. Germline Mutations](https://opengenetics.pressbooks.tru.ca/chapter/somatic-vs-germline-mutations/)
# Somatic cells vs. Germline cells
- In multicellular animals, there is a partitioning early in development into **somatic cells**, which form the body cells, and **germline cells**, which form the gametes for the next generation.
- Somatic cells form the tissues of the organism and are not passed on as gametes.
- Germline cells are those that form the eggs or sperm cells (ovum or pollen in plants), and are passed on to form the next generation.
# Somatic mutation
- Any mutations in somatic cells will only affect the individual in which they occur, not its progeny.
- If mutations occur in somatic cells, its mutant descendants will exist alongside other non-mutant (wild type) cells.
- If the mutation occurs at a very early stage of development, the mutation will be present in more cells.
- This gives rise to an individual composed of two or more types of cells that differ in their genetic composition. Such an individual is said to be a **mosaic**.
# Germline mutation
- Mutations in germline cells will be passed on to the next generation but wonâ€™t affect the individual in which they occur.
- In animals, somatic cells are segregated from germ line cells.
	- In plants, somatic cells become germline cells; so somatic mutations can become germline mutations.
