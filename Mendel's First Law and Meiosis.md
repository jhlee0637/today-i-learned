# Mendle's study of garden pea plant
- After eight years of tedious experiments with garden pea plants, Mendel proposed his foundational principles of inheritance.
- Mendel showed that white-flowered plants could be produced by crossing two purple-flowered plants, but only if the purple-flowered plants themselves had at least one white-flowered parent.
- Mendel’s observations disproved blending inheritance and favoured an alternative concept, called **particulate inheritance**, in which heredity is the product of discrete factors that control independent traits.
# Mendel's First law
- Through careful study of patterns of inheritance, Mendel recognized that a single trait could exist in different versions, or **alleles**, even within an individual plant or animal.
- This is the basis of **Mendel’s First Law**, also called **The Law of Equal Segregation**, which states that, during gamete formation the two alleles at a gene locus segregate from each other, and each gamete has an equal probability of containing either allele.
# Dominant and Recessive Alleles
- The dominant/recessive character is a relationship between two alleles and must be determined by observation of the heterozygous phenotype.
- Remember, alleles are different versions of a gene. The relationship of different alleles of a gene can be described as complete dominance, incomplete dominance, or co-dominance.
- The traits Mendel studied with his peas were all completely dominant.
- In a diploid organism, if an allele is **dominant,** only one copy of that allele is necessary to express the dominant phenotype.
- If an allele is **recessive**, then the gene needs to have two copies (or be homozygous) to express the recessive phenotype.
# Meiosis
- Most eukaryotes reproduce sexually — a cell from one individual joins with a cell from another to create offspring. To be successful, the cells that fuse must contain half the number of chromosomes as in the adult organism.
- The chromosome number is reduced through the process of **meiosis**.
- Most multicellular organisms use meiosis to produce **gametes**, the cells that fuse to make offspring.
- You will hear of cells that have not yet undergone meiosis to become egg or sperm cells called oocytes or spermatocytes respectively.
- Meiosis begins similarly to mitosis in that a cell has grown large enough to divide and has replicated its chromosomes. However, Meiosis requires two rounds of division.
- Meiosis has two main stages, designated by the roman numerals I and II.
	- In **Meiosis I** homologous chromosomes segregate
	- In **Meiosis II** sister chromatids segregate
## Meiosis I
- Cells that will undergo meiosis are called **meiocytes** and are diploid (2N)
- Meiosis I is called a **reductional** division, because it reduces the number of chromosomes inherited in each of the daughter cells – the parent cell is 2N while the two daughter cells are each 1N.
- Meiosis I is further divided into...
	- Prophase I
	- Metaphase I
	- Anaphase I
	- Telophase I
- During synapsis, proteins bind to both homologous chromosomes along their entire length and form the **synaptonemal complex** (synapse means junction). These proteins hold the chromosomes in the transient structure of a bivalent. The proteins are released when the cell enters Anaphase I.

### Meiosis I - Prophase I
- Initially, chromosomes condense and become visible and centrosomes begin to migrate to opposite poles of the cell
- Homologous chromosomes enter synapsis and the synaptonemal complex forms
- **Crossing over** occurs resulting in an exchange of genetic material between non-sister chromatids of a homologous chromosome pair
	- **Crossing over** occurs within the synaptonemal complex.
	-  A crossover is a place where DNA repair enzymes break the DNA of two non-sister chromatids in similar locations and then covalently reattach non-sister chromatids together to create a crossover between non-sister chromatids.
	- Crossovers function to hold homologous chromosomes together during meiosis I so they orient correctly and segregate successfully and reshuffles the allele combinations along a chromosome.
- Following this, the synaptonemal complex disappears and tetrads are visible
- Crossover points appear as **chiasmata** which hold non-sister chromatids together
- Finally, chromatids thicken and shorten, the nuclear membrane dissolves and spindle fibers begin forming.
### Meiosis I - Metaphase I 
- Tetrads line up on the equator or the metaphase plate and each chromosome of a homologous pair attaches to spindle fibers from opposite ends of the poles – sister chromatids attach to fibers from the same pole.
### Meiosis I - Anaphase I
- Chiasmata dissolve
- Homologous chromosomes move to opposite poles
	- one member of each pair migrates to each daughter cell (1N)
(note: centromeres do not separate here.)
### Meiosis I - Telophase I
- The nuclear envelope reforms and the resulting cells have half the number of chromosomes, each consisting of two sister chromatids.
### Interkinesis/Cytokinesis
- Similar to interphase except no chromosome duplication occurs. Daughter nuclei become enclosed into separate daughter cells.
## Meiosis II
- At the completion of Meiosis I, there are two cells, each with one, replicated copy of each chromosome (1N).
- Meiosis II resembles mitosis, with one sister chromatid from each chromosome separating to produce two daughter cells.
- Because Meiosis II, like mitosis, results in the segregation of sister chromatids, Meiosis II is called an **equational** division
### Meiosis II - Prophase II
- Chromosomes condense
- Centrioles move towards the poles
- The nuclear envelope disintegrates
### Meiosis II - Metaphase II
- Chromosomes align at the equator or the metaphase plate
- Sister chromatids attach to spindle fibres from opposite poles
### Meiosis II - Anaphase II
- Centromeres divide
- Sister chromatids move to opposite poles
### Meiosis II - Telophase II
- Chromosomes begin to uncoil
- Nuclear envelope and nucleoli begin to reform
### Cytokinesis
- Division of the cytoplasm occurs, resulting in four new daughter cells
- Each containing haploid number of chromosomes

- Note how Meiosis I and II are both divided into prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase, since those stages have similar features to mitosis. After two rounds of cytokinesis, four cells will be produced, each with a single copy of each chromosome in the set.
# Gamete Maturation
- In animals and plants, the cells produced by meiosis need to mature before they become functional gametes.
- In male animals, the four products of meiosis are called **spermatids**.
	- They grow structures, like tails, and become functional sperm cells.
- In female animals, the gametes are **eggs**.
	- For each egg to contain the maximum amount of nutrients.
	- Typically only one of the four products of meiosis becomes **an egg.**
	- The other three cells end up as tiny disposable cells called **polar bodies.**
- In plants, the products of meiosis reproduce a few times using mitosis as they develop into functional male or female gametes.
