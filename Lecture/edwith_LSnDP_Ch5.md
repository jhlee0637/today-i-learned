Chapter 5: The Application of Computer Simulations
# Real World's Problems
- Developing a specialized solution -> theorical
- Developing a managerial solution -> sophisticated 
- To solve problems, both views to problems are required
- To solve porblems, we need to comprehend the problem first
## How to comprehend a problem?
- Estimate the future of a given status-quo
- Estimate the progress of problems factors in the system
- However, the real world's problem is not a well-defined progrmming
	- It's hard to model the real world's problem correctly
# Why Modeling?
- It is difficult to trace the real-world problems
- To simplify the problem, we create a model
	- The model is an essence of the real world problems
## What to remove from the real-world problem?
- Think what to reamin in the model
- Think what to remove
- Determined by objectives
# Two Types of Models
## Models to solve: numerical modeling
- Goal: Converting the real-world problems into formula. Then, finding optimal solutions through solvers
- Example:
	- Linear programming
	- Integer programming
## Models to simulate: system dynamics/discrete event models/agent based models
- Goal: Approximating to the real world problems. Then, finding the optimal solutions through **repetitive simulations**
- Example:
	- Event graphs
	- petri-net
	- agent modeling
